Technology has changed the way of business. Many businesses have been able to reach out to a
bigger audience with the help of e-Commerce platforms. Even at stores, a proper database
management system has benefitted the owners in keeping a track of the inventory along with
lucidly managing the accounts and finance.

Our focus for this project is to build a Website that will primarily focus on Small Stores, like a
local ‘Kirana’ shop. We know that with so many technology companies trying to establish a loyal
customer base, affording an electronic device has become easier than before. Many organizations
are selling their products at very affordable rates to the lower income group as well.

We want to help the shopkeepers maintain their store. These local shops have a loyal base of
customers from the neighborhood, who also buy things and pay at the end of the month. We want
to create a digital system that will integrate the loaning feature with the website and help the
shopkeeper keep a track of the customers and the amount they owe.
